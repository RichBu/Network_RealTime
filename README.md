Real time network for production / machine monitoring

Demonstration of a real time production monitoring system.
Full system is multiple machines and different types.

One option is to use a pre-packaged software package. Besides
the high costs, most are just limited.  By using full stack
web development skills, it's really easy to upload the data
to a mySQL database backend. At the same time data is sent
to FireBase, which is Google's real-time database.

So, if there is a data change, it is pushed to the user
as fast as the network allows.
